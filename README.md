# PlayStation vs. XBOX Console Sales Data

This data describes the sales performance of Playstation and Xbox consoles within the gaming industry. Historically showing strenghts in the sales between the two brand consoles within the market of technology. This data analyze the console sales of Playstation and Xbox throughout the years since its debut.



## Point of View Project

I wanted to do a sales on video games between two consoles. Playstaion and XBOX. I have played both of these consoles over the past decade when the first
consoles came out. I mainly played Playstation since its the only game that I grew up on. But later down the line, I played games on the XBOX 360 during
the lifespan before the XBOX One. It gives me insight of how both of these consoles have dominated the video game market of the past decade since its 
debut. How games these days that players played show a significant difference of how they scale in sales worldwide.
